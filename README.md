# **CSS Portfolio Assignment**

## **Assignment Intention**
For this assignment:
* I was attempting to create a portfolio showing off the "work that I have created". You will see a picture of me, my name, as well as navigational links that take you directly to the section on the page that it corresponds with. 
* In my work section you will see a collection of my pervious work with links to the sites attached to the images. You will see a larger project displayed compared to the others.
* I was also attempting to show a responsive layout, when the window size is reduced to any size smaller than 992px, the header in the "About Me", "Work", and "Contact" background styles change from orange to a lightblue. The images in the first section of work also utlize flexwrap to respond to changes in window size.
